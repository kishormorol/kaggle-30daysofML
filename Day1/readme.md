Completed #day1 of #30daysofML by #kaggle.

The Assignment was the famous "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster". 

Here, we need to predict the number of passengers who survived after the events of Titanic from the given dataset.  

Solution: There are many ml algorithms can be applied for solving the problem but I used random forest algorithm and scored 0.78 (it can be increased with a bit tuning 🧐)
